# Machine-Learning-Image-Styler
## Used Neural Networks to create a styling image filtering program
### It recognizes features of content image and then combines it to work with a styling image to generate new image
## Python based Project using Tensorflow
Link to Download vgg_image_file:  https://goo.gl/2hck1z which should be in same directory as neural_style.py
Default: 1000 iterations to change the number of iterations for training use option --iterations=<value>
To run use the command python neural_style.py --content <content_image_path> --style <style_image_path> --output <result_image_path>
